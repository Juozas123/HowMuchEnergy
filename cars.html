        <p>One by one, countries are making plans to switch to electrical transport.<br>
        Some countries have already decided to allow only electric cars to be sold after 2040.</p>
        <p>Internal combustion engine is a mature technology. There will probably no great improvements.<br>
        So we should look for electric cars and new models appearing in the market.<br>
        So far electric cars are a bit more expensive, than conventional ones, but they cost a lot less to run.<br>
        Also, electric drivetrain is a lot simpler, with less moving parts - so in theory could be really reliable and easy to maintain.</p>
