            <h2 id="sectionIntro">Intro</h2>
            <p>Hello, Dear visitor! Most of us use things without giving a thought about their energy usage.<br>
                Leave the lights on, leave the car running, etc..
            </p>
            <p>It's not a big deal, but if we're a little smarter about that, we could save some money and <br>
                help the environment too. See the data below, some things might surprise you!
            </p>

            <h2 id="sectionNumbers">How to understand the numbers?</h2>
            <p>Power is measured in Watts(W).<br>
            Think about your car. It has an engine with X horsepower. One horsepower is equal to 746 watts.<br>
            So, the more "watts" your car engine has, the faster it is.</p>

            <p>Energy is measured in Kilowatt Hours (kWh).<br>
            Basically, it refers to the use of power over time.<br>
            Let's say your car has a 1HP = 746 watt engine. If you drive your car for an hour, you will use 746Wh.<br>
            Or 0.746kWh (it's like grams/kilo-grams, to get the bigger unit you just divide by 10<sup>3</sup>).</p>

            <h2 id="sectionExamples">Basic examples</h2>
            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>Single LED - 1 W</li>
                <li>Laptop computer - 15-30 W</li>
                <li>Human body metabolism - 80W</li>
                <li>Fridge - 100W</li>
                <li>Microwave - 1000W</li>
                <li>Typical Car - 50,000W</li>
                <li>Flying a passenger plane - 140,000,000W</li>
                <li>Space shuttle liftoff - 11,000,000,000W</li>
                <li>United States average use - 840,000,000,000W</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Last few examples are a bit silly, but some basic things emerge - 
                driving a car for 1 hour uses the same energy as using a laptop for 1,666 hours!!!<br>
            <span class="footNote">NOTE: numbers are approximate, but you can get the picture.</span></p>

            <h2 id="sectionHome">Energy at home - how to save?</h2>
            </a>

            <p>As you can see from the previous paragraph, the energy use of things in our homes is really diverse.<br>
            Even though we think we are saving money by turning of the lights at the house, we may be much better off<br>
            by getting a more efficient fridge or something similar, which has a much higher total energy consumption.</p>

            <h3>Top energy users:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cooling and heating - 47%</li>
                <li>Water heater - 14%</li>
                <li>Washer and drier - 13%</li>
                <li>Lighting - 12%</li>
                <li>Fridge - 4%</li>
                <li>Oven - 4%</li>
                <li>TV, other media devices - 3%</li>
                <li>Laptop - 1%</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So you can keep banging away on your laptop - not going to lose much money.<br>
            Simple smart things to do:</p>
            <ul class="listEmptyBuble">
                <li>Set times for heating and cooling - you don't need a hot house when you're away</li>
                <li>Get good quality LED lightbulbs - they last long and use much less energy</li>
                <li>When you need to buy some new appliance - pay some attention to it's energy efficiency</li>
                <li>A general one - do you <i>REALLY</i> need that new thing you're buying? Try to avoid compulsive shopping</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are the basic things you can do, and in my opinion, to not feel guilty about wasting energy.<br>
            You could destroy your entire house and build a more efficient one - but that's just another waste of resources.<br>
            I'm guessing we're better off by just being smart and frugal. And getting rid of some uneccessary things.</p>

            <h2 id="sectionCars">Energy and cars</h2>
            </a>

            <p>Cars are expensive things and replacing them is rarely an option.<br>
            However, when shopping for a new car, you can make a choice.</p>
            <p>Typical emissions:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Small family car powered by internal combustion engine - 150-200g of CO<suP>2</sup> per km.</li>
                <li>Hybrid car - 100g of CO<sup>2</sup> per km.</li>
                <li>Small electric car - 70g of CO<sup>2</sup> per km.</li>
            </ol></p>

            <p>These numbers are very, very approximate. But the basic truth is - electric transport is greener and <i>cheaper to run</i>.<br>
            We shouldn't forget the fact, that if our nations electricity supply gets greener - our cars will automatically get greener too!</p>

            <p>If you can - go for an electric car. No? Maybe a hybrid. Still no? Well, just get a traditional car with a smallest engine<br>
            that suits you and you're fine.</p>

            <h2 id="sectionFood">Food choices</h2>

            <p>There are a lot of discussions regarding food and it's effect on the environment.<br> 
            It's actually quite difficult to understand what is right and what is wrong. However, a few points tend to repeat themselves. <br>
            Try to eat: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Locally grown foods</li>
                <li>Foods grown in season</li>
                <li>Not waste food</li>
                <li>Eat a little less meat</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 id="sectionConclusion">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>As simple citizens we can and should do a little to protect the environment.<br>
            It is always worth to do good, when you have a choice.<br>
            However, I think that most responsibility to solve environmental problems falls on the shoulders of our goverment.<br>
            Laws and regulations need to be adjusted, so that the whole system shifts towards more sustainable living.<br>
            But until that happens - let's work together and show willingness to live in a way that does not damage the environment.<br>
            <br>
            Thanks for reading!</p>
